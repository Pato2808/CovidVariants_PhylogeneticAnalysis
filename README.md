# CovidVariants_PhylogeneticAnalysis

The purpose of this work is to observe through a pylogenetic analisys how a virus can mutate into different variants with completely different characteristics. 
In this analysis they're compared twenty SARS-COV-19 variants observed in different times and countries all over the world. Said variants were analized by observing their 
nucleotides secuences obtained by using the NCBI data base and using an algorithm designed for this specific purpose. I encourage people to modify the code so they can analise 
other kind of viruses and observe the phylogenetic tree of said viruses. All you have to do to modify the code is go to NCBI, take the accession key (##_######), the place and 
time the sample was collected and put that into the vectors in the code. Be carefull to put the variants accession key in the same order as the place and time so the 
phylogenetic tree doesn't comes with any errors in the labels.

This proyect was made by Patricio Mendoza Pasapera as an assignment for a college class.
